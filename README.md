# Hadoop_Scheduling

Authors: Yunzhe Li, Kangping Yi and Fan Xu @SJTU

This is a demo of the course project in Algorithm@SJTU. The course project focuses on resource scheduling problem in Hadoop. Considering the two versions of resource scheduling on single or multiple hosts, we design a comprehensive algorithm to solve both problems simultaneously. Based on simulated annealing algorithm, we first construct a feasible solution, then search in the field of feasible solutions, and accept the new solution with a certain probability, and get the final result through several iterations. Experiments show that our method can get a relatively good result in a short time.
